# Problems To Solve

1. Navigate a 2D grid maze
2. Traveling salesman

## Possible Others

-   making a travel schedule generator
    -   input places you want to go (google api for location and hours)
    -   also include what kind of activity (food, dessert, active, sight seeing, coffee) (this could be taken from google potentially)
        -   we don't want two of the same activity back to back
    -   how long you want at each place
    -   input days you are there total
    -   input when you are looking to wake up and go to bed
    -   input times you would like to eat (roughly)
    -   the algorithm should try not to put food back to back
    -   it outputs an itinerary

## Process

-   For each problem, show the classical solution with benchmarks and compare to the Rayleigh solution with benchmarks.
-   Label each problem with: **Binary**, **Permutation**, **Real-Value** or any other genotypes covered.
