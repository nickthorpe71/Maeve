# Maeve

Open source, extendable, versatile framework for prototyping and applying genetic algorithms.

## What is Maeve?

A framework to use parameterized inputs to create and utilize genetic algorithms easily. The idea is it's easy to experiment with different parameters, observe the results, then when you've found the parameters that work best for your solution, run the framework in performance mode to calculate at a very efficient rate.
